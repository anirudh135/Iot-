Iot description
The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data.[1][2][3] Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of about 30 billion objects by 2020.[4]

"Things", in the IoT sense, can refer to a wide variety of deviclassces such as heart monitoring implants, biochip transponders on farm animals, cameras streaming live feeds of wild animals in coastal waters,[10] automobiles with built-in sensors, DNA analysis devices for environmental/food/pathogen monitoring,[11] or field operation devices that assist firefighters in search and rescue operations.[12] Legal scholars suggest regarding "things" as an "inextricable mixture of hardware, software, data and service".[13]
